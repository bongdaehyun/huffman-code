Jules: Okay, let me just review this with you.
You have six bridesmaids. You ordered six of the silk chiffon Antoinette dresses in pink.
The wedding is in three days, and the dresses just arrived all in charcoal gray, which we don't even sell, so that is a bit of a mystery.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do about this. I am gonna call the vendor and have this fixed today.
I will personally see the dresses before they are Fed Exed, and I promise you they will be at your front door by 9:00 a.m. Friday, okay? You know what, let me give you my cell just in case, 718-555-0199.
Oh, thank you so much for your patience, and I am gonna refund you back all your money. it's the... Yes. Okay, hey, you check this one off your list, okay?
This is done. And, Rachel, have a great wedding. 
Oh, my God, how did that happen?

Becky: Jules?

Jules: I know, I know, I'm late for something.

Ben: Well...

Petty: I could make a little salad, turn it into a dinner for two, like we did that time and never did again. You know that was over five months ago?

Ben: Oh, yeah. No, no, we gotta do that again, for sure, but okay if we take a rain check?

Petty: You're awful cute, you know that?

Ben: No, I didn't.
Becky: Yeah, everything.

Jules: You see why I take customer service calls?
I mean, it's so good. You learn so much. Okay, what's up? What am I doing?

Becky: Okay, Cameron was waiting for you, but had another meeting.
He said he'll be back at 2:00. Um, everyone needs you to sign off on tomorrow's homepage.

Jules: Right.

Becky: And your 11:00 is in the big conference room. So is your 11:10. 
Finance needs you, and I guess you e-mailed a bunch of people at 4:00 a.m. about something?

Jules: Oh, good, I forgot about that.
I want to figure out a way for friends to shop together online.
Make it less of an alone thing. E-mail me that idea, will you?

Becky: Yeah, I like that. Um, is now a good time to call your mom back?

Jules: Dude, I'm on a bike.
 
- Happy birthday!
 
Jules: Oh! Oh, what a mess- This is the middle of the office. Don't do... Don't put that--

- Hello.

Ben: Hi. I'm Ben Whittaker. I received an e-mail about an interview for the senior intern program.

- Hey, Ben. How's it goin'?

Ben: It's going good, real good. Thank you.
 
-Excellent. Take a seat around the corner, and someone from talent acquisition will come get you.
 
Ben: Thank you. "Talent acquisition"?
 
Jules: Okay, you guys have to remember; the homepage has to read in a glance.

Also, you have to get back like this if you wanna see what it looks like if you're, like, over 35.
Okay, so I can't read anything, but if I could, what do you want me to see?
"Five Girls, One Shirt" or "Check Out The Fit"?
 
Robby: Well, both, but what I really want you to see is the shirt worn by five different body types.

Jules: Okay, then you gotta make me see that. Try making the photo grid bigger. I love that five.
Can we make it more graphic? Yeah, that's cool. Maybe hero the girl in the red shirt.

Robby: Jules...

Jules: That is a great red. It is going to fly outta here.

Robby: I needed you to sign off on this, like, two hours ago.
 
Jules: I know, I know, but can you try?

Robby: Yep.
 
Jules: Mia? Tell me that thing again.

Mia: Oh, 40% of our visitors don't go past the homepage, which isn't so bad.

Jules: Yeah, but we should fix that.
 
Robby: Okay, here you go.
 
Jules: I love it.
 
Robby: Great, and it's up.
 
Jules: Okay. Thanks, everybody.
 
-Thank you.
 
Jules: Okay, so... The Antoinette dress. Major screw-up by the vendor.
 
Keria: There's gonna be a couple of interviews today, Ben. 
We wanna make sure that we both find the right fit.
Business as usual is not really our motto, so we hope you have some fun here.
This is the first time we are hiring senior interns, so some of our intern questions may not exactly fit your profile, but we're gonna go for it anwvay, okay?
 
Ben: Fire away.
 
Keria: Okay, good. Where'd you go to school?
 
Ben: I went to Northwestern.

Keria: Hey, my brother went to Northwestern.

Ben: Probably not at the same time.

Keria: Probably not. He graduated in 2009.

Ben: Class of '65

Keria: Wow, what was your major? Do you remember?
 
Samantha: And after Northwestern, you went on to...
 
Ben: I went to work for Dex One.
 
Samantha: Okay, and they made...

Ben: Phonebooks. I was in charge of overseeing the printing of the physical phonebook.
I did that for over 20 years, and before that I was their VP of sales and advertising.

Samantha: So, do they still make phonebooks? I mean, doesn't everyone just Google numbers?

Ben: I believe they do, but before Google that was how you got...
 
Samantha: Oh, no, no. Yeah, I get it.
 
Justin: So 40 years at the phonebook company? That is amazing, seriously.
Okay, Benjamin. Now, I'm gonna ask you one of our more telling questions for all of our interns, so I want you to, like, this is the one to really think about, okay?
And take your time. Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
Ben: When I'm 80?
 
Justin: Yeah, sure. Yeah, whatever. Um... Wait. Did not realize you were 70.
That question just doesn't work for you, does it? Should we just scratch that one and just move on?
 
Ben: It's your call, Justin.
 
Justin: Okay, that one's gone. 
You look great, by the way, so great, and you're clearly more than qualified for this job.
You're actually, like, way overqualified, and we were so impressed.
You had great interviews, great video. You nailed it, Ben. Congrats. You're an intern.
 
Cameron: Hey. I need you for two minutes, uninterrupted.

Jules: Okay.
Cameron: Remember a few weeks ago, we talked about the senior intern program?
 
Jules: No.
 
Cameron: Really? We had a whole, big conversation about it.
 
Jules: We did? Okay, remind me. Seniors in high school or college?
 
Cameron: No, no, no. Seniors in life. Older people.
 
Jules: Hold on. What?
 
Cameron: I told you I felt like we needed to do an outreach program.
You definitely seemed to be liking the idea, so I set it in motion. It's gonna be great.
 
Jules: Hold, please. You're hiring senior citizen interns?
 
Cameron: There's been a ton of research on this, and the results are actually incredible.
I mean, imagine having an intern with a lifetime of experience as opposed to somebody who spent the last four years of their life playing beer pong.

Jules: Do they eventually want jobs here?
 
Cameron: No, darling, they're all retired. They just want the experience.
And I would like one to work directly with you.
 
Jules: Wait, Cameron, no. First of all, I'm not great with older people.
You know how I am with my parents. This could be... Why do I have to have one?
 
Cameron: Because you have to set the tone. Now, would you prefer a man or a woman?
There's a great 72-year-old woman, really cute.

Jules: That's like the same age as my mom. That's too weird.
 
Cameron: That's fine. There's a man everyone loves. 
He seems amazing. I watched his video with the whole group. People were crying.

Jules: Okay, this is not going to work, in my opinion. 
But how long do I have to do this for? Minimum?
 
Jules: Okay, this is not going to work, in my opinion. 
But how long do I have to do this for? Minimum?
 
Cameron: Six weeks, or we'll be sued.
 
Jules: I know we never talked about this.
 
Cameron: Yeah, we did. For real. He starts tomorrow.
 
Ben: Hmm.  Back in action. Thank God.
 
Jason: New interns, welcome to A TF.
We all work on this one floor, and that is because we are all about communication and teamwork.
No one has a private office, not even our founder and CEO, Jules Ostin, who is actually right over there. She loves to ride her bike through the office.
That woman does not like to waste time. Plus, she counts it as exercise. 

Doris: That's adorable.

Jason: Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

Davis: Hey. How you doing? I'm Davis.
 
Ben: Hi, Davis. Ben Whittaker. Exciting place, huh?

Davis: Oh, my God. They had one opening for a regular-age intern, no offense. 
I got it.  I'm so psyched.
 
Ben: I'm pretty psyched myself.
 
Jason: All right, a few words about Jules. She started About The Fit only 18 months ago.
This whole idea was hatched at Jules' kitchen table right here in Brooklyn.
Jules tried everything on that she sold, described the fit herself, and apparently, it worked.
She was online in four months. She started with 25 employees. She's now up to 216. With you four, 220.
 
Ben: Wow.

Davis: Hey, Ben, are you gonna wear a suit every day?
 
Ben: You bet.
 
Davis: Confident. I like how you roll. I like it a lot.
 
- We just hit a record high of 2,500 likes on Instagram.
 
Jason: And that's what we do when something good happens around here.
New interns, grab a seat at one of the intern tables over there.
Check your e-mail. You may find that you've been assigned to one particular person or one particular team. Or you might just be a floater it's all good. 
Okay, let me Instagram this. Moment in time. Gray is the new green. Take a seat.
 
Ben: Thanks. Oh, got one.
 
Cameron: Welcome, Ben. Your internship will be directly with our founder; Jules Ostin
 
Cameron: Six weeks, or we'll be sued.
